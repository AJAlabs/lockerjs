## Locker.js - "A Node.js locker for your stuff"

So you've created your "Hello World" app and want to start hacking on something a little more challenging?

Locker.js is a simple project to learn Node.js.

If you like it, please feel free to fork it and use it as your own. At the moment I don't have any future development plans for this project other than to use it to play around with Node.js.

1. [Fork and clone this repo](https://github.com/AJAlabs/lockerjs/fork)

2. From your local clone run `npm install`

3. All you have to do now is fire up your app! `node app`

### Usage

- Add files to the public directory to be served in the browser
